# Getting Started
Some basic experiments. 
- A simple clock which ticks every 1 second
- High order component


# Simple Clock

![Simple clock!](images/simple_clock.png "Bootstrap experiments")

Demonstrates how we are using  `useState` hook and click handlers to create and destroy javascript clock


# High order component

Demonstrates how we can pass a click handler method via `props` from an outer component to the inner component. This is very useful to de-couple complexity and improve testability

# How to run?
```npm install```

```npm run start```
